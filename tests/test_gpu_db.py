"""Tests for dbgpu-backed bandwidth resolution on detected hardware.

The detection path must never give a laptop/mobile card its desktop bandwidth
(issues #74, #61, #93). These tests pin the strict matching rules: curated
values win, the curated lookup is mobile-aware, dbgpu fills gaps, and an
unknown card resolves to None rather than a wrong guess.
